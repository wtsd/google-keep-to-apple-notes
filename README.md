# Google Keep to Apple Notes Converter

This tool converts your **Google Keep** notes (exported via Google Takeout) into an **Evernote ENEX** file, which can then be imported directly into **Apple Notes**.

## Features
- Preserves titles, text, checklists, timestamps, labels, and attachments.
- Converts Keep-specific properties into tags (e.g., pinned, archived, colors).
- Supports both zipped Takeout exports and already-unzipped directories.

## Requirements
- Python 3.9+

## Usage

1. **Export from Google Keep** using [Google Takeout](https://takeout.google.com/).
2. Save the exported `.zip` file or unzip it.
3. Run the converter:

```bash
python keep_to_enex.py --input /path/to/Takeout.zip --output keep.enex
# or, if unzipped:
python keep_to_enex.py --input /path/to/Takeout/Keep --output keep.enex
```

4. In **Apple Notes** (macOS): `File → Import to Notes…` and select the `keep.enex` file.

## Notes
- Attachments and checklists are preserved.
- Labels are turned into tags.
- Note colors and other Keep-specific metadata are stored as tags.
- Large archives: The script skips problematic notes but continues processing.
